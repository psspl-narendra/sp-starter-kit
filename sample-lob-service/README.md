# PnP SharePoint Starter Kit - LOB Service

This folder contains an ASP.NET MVC Web API application that emulates a LOB system, which you can host on Microsoft Azure (or wherever you like) and consume through the LobIntegration sample client-side Web Part defined in the PnP Starter Kit project. Further instruction will come about how to setup this LOB service and about how to configure the LobIntegration Web Part.
