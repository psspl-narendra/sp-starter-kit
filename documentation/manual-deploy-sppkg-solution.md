# Manually deploy the SP Starter Kit .sppkg SPFx solution to the tenant App Catalog

The SP Starter Kit [`deployment process`](../provisiniong/readme.md) will automatically rebuild and deploy the included SPFx solution to your tenant app catalog. You can also pre-deploy [`sharepoint-starter-kit.sppkg`](../package/sharepoint-starter-kit.sppkg) from the [`/package`](../package) folder manually to the tenant app catalog, as well as ['manually approve the requested permissions`](api-management.md).

## Pre-requirements

1. You will need tenant admin access.

2. You will already have to have created an Application Catalog from your SharePoint Admin Center. **Note**: A newly created app catalog may take a few minutes to a few hours to fully provision.

1. Load your tenant app catalog in a browser, i.e. http://[tenant].sharepoint.com/sites/apps

2. Drag and drop [`sharepoint-starter-kit.sppkg`](../package/sharepoint-starter-kit.sppkg) from the [`/package`](../package) folder into your `app catalog`.

3. Wait for the upload to complete.

4. After a successful package upload, you will be asked to trust the solution. You will want to `Make this solution available to all sites in the organization`. Also note that you will need to approve api permissions after 'deploying' the solution.

5. Your solution should now be deployed.
