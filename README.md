# SharePoint Starter Kit

This is a solution designed for SharePoint Online which provides numerous web parts, extensions, and other components which you can use as an example and inspiration for your own customizations. 

> Please be aware that **documentation work is still in progress** and we will keep on provide more guidance and input around covered capabilities in this solution. In the meantime, please submit issues and questions using the [issues list](../../issues) to help us provide better documentation and guidance. Thanks for your patience!

## Objectives of this solution

SharePoint Communication Sites have great out-of-the-box capabilities, but the out-of-the-box capabilities may not always be sufficient for your scenarios. This is exactly why you are able to include your own customizations. This solution addresses common scenarios and tasks you may encounter when introducing those customizations, and provides examples and guidance on how you might address them including:

- Automated provisioning of simple demo content within a communication site
- Automated provisioning of the whole solution to any tenant within minutes
- Automated configuration of Site Scripts and Site Designs at the tenant level using the PnP Remote Provisioning engine
- Implementation of different customizations for SharePoint Online
- Usage of Office UI Fabric and reusable PnP SPFx controls within the customizations

## Pre-requirements

Here are current pre-requirements for making this solution work in your tenant.

- You will need to be a tenant administrator to be able to deploy this solution
    - Notice that you can get free developer tenant from [Office 365 developer program](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dev-program), if needed.
- Automatic end-to-end provisioning only works with English tenants
    - All solutions and web parts are also English in the current implementation
    - For tenants that have English but have a different default language, the [term set provisioning may be modified to assist with installation](./documentation/term-store.md#non-english-tenants).

- Release preferences for your tenant will need to be set as "Targeted release for everyone" option (also known as First Release)
- Add the used tenant administrator account as Term Store Administrator in the Taxonomy Term Store through the SharePoint Admin Center
- A tenant 'App Catalog' must have been created within the 'Apps' option of the SharePoint Admin Center

## Getting started

Shortest path to success: The following steps will help you get started in any tenant as fast as possible:

- Ensure that you meet the [requirements for SharePoint Framework development](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/spfx/set-up-your-development-environment) and are using the latest version of [PnP PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/sharepoint/sharepoint-pnp/sharepoint-pnp-cmdlets?view=sharepoint-ps)
- Prepare your tenant, by accomplishing the tasks highlighted in document [Preparing your tenant for the PnP SharePoint Starter Kit](./documentation/tenant-settings.md).
- Open PowerShell, and use PnP PowerShell to connect to any site in your tenant with the [`Connect-PnPOnline` cmdlet](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/sharepoint-pnp/connect-pnponline?view=sharepoint-ps) using your own tenant url

```powershell
Connect-PnPOnline https://contosodemosk.sharepoint.com
```

- Change to the `provisioning` folder found in SP Starter Kit solution root and execute the following command (using your own tenant url and the prefix of your choosing):
    - Refer to the ['provisioning documentation'](./provisioning) for advanced provisioning options and guidance
    - If you run into errors during provisioning, refer to ['Common SP Starter Kit Provisioning results'](./documentation/common-provision-results.md) for additional suggestions and common mistakes

```powershell
Apply-PnPTenantTemplate -Path starterkit.pnp -Parameters @{"SiteUrlPrefix"="demo"}
```

This will provision 3 site collections with urls of `/sites/demoportal`, `/sites/demohr`, and `/sites/demomarketing`. Your urls may vary depending on the SitePrefix you use and the managed path you selected for team sites in your tenant administration (this defaults to 'sites').


> Notice that the starter kit also adds tenant level settings like themes, site designs, taxonomy term sets, and other adjustments. Therefore, it is recommended to test the starter kit in an **isolated test tenant and not immediately execute it within your production environment**.
